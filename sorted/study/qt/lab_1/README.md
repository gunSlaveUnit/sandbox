# Lab 1. Color Text Changer
Variant 5.

Develop an application "Color Editor 2" that allows you to set an 
arbitrary color in RGB format and display text in this color.

The application interface is represented by a group (QGroupBox) of 
three color switches (QRadioButton), buttons "+" and "−", and an element 
for displaying some message (for example, greetings). 

Depending on the selected button of the group of switches (RED, GREEN, BLUE), 
pressing the “+” button increases the numerical value of the selected color component for the palette used when displaying the message, and pressing the “−” button decreases it.
